<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>The
Proportions of Truth.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many wise sayings of
Paschal there is one that deserves our most attentive study:
viz., that few heresies have their origin in simple error, but
that all that have ever attained to power have originated in the
exaggeration of truth.&nbsp; Without that element of truth there
would be no power in the error.&nbsp; This principle is in
perfect harmony with all we see around us.&nbsp; In everything
there are certain proportions, and nothing can compensate for
their loss.</p>
<p>In art the painter may mix his colours in the most perfect
combination; he may bring out each feature with all the power of
a Rembrandt, but if the head is twice too large for the body, or
the nose for the face, his beautiful painting becomes nothing
better than a ridiculous caricature.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>In nature
God has fitted the parts of each tree in beautiful
proportion.&nbsp; Each part&mdash;the root, the stem, the branch,
the leaf,&mdash;does its work in perfect harmony.&nbsp; And many
a beautiful tree bears nothing, simply because an ignorant
gardener, by what he calls pruning, has disturbed the proportions
of its parts.</p>
<p>In music it is the same, and Shakespeare knew it when he
wrote,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How
sour sweet music is<br />
When time is broke, and no proportion kept.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is no illustration more perfect than that of
light.&nbsp; In pure white light there are many parts, but all in
perfect harmony.&nbsp; Let any one colour be left out, or its
strength be diminished, and the pure white is seen no more.&nbsp;
If we wish for purity in light we must have the whole spectrum,
and have it just as God has given it.&nbsp; Let man disturb it in
any way whatever, let him keep back any colour, because it does
not suit his taste, or isolate any other colour, because for it
he feels a special preference, and the result will be that he
will no longer look on the pure bright light of heaven.&nbsp; He
need not introduce any new element; all that he has to do is to
keep back a part and to disturb the proportion, and by that
simple and easy process he can substitute a colour <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>of his own
devising for the pure brightness of the sunbeam.</p>
<p>I believe it to be just the same with the truth of God.&nbsp;
It is clearly so with <i>the Lord Himself</i>.&nbsp; As He is
perfect in every detail, so is He perfect in the proportions of
His attributes.&nbsp; Every attribute is in its place, and every
attribute perfect; and all are so beautifully fitted together,
that the highest desire of the heart thirsting for God is to come
&ldquo;to the perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the
fulness of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it is with <i>the faith</i>, or God&rsquo;s great plan of
life, continued and carried out in His own boundless love, for
the salvation of His people.&nbsp; Of course in this plan there
are many parts,&mdash;incarnation, life, atonement, resurrection,
mediation, etc.&nbsp; There is the work of the Father, the work
of the Son, and the work of the Holy Ghost; and, besides that,
there is the act of the believer,&mdash;seeking Christ, receiving
Christ, and living to His glory.&nbsp; And of the whole it may be
most truly said, &ldquo;As for God.&nbsp; His work is
perfect.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole plan, and every part of it, is
Divine.&nbsp; Each part is complete, and each of these complete
parts being fitted together in complete proportion, form, when
thus fitted, a grand, a perfect, an harmonious whole.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Just so
it is with <i>Sacred Scripture</i>.&nbsp; Some people speak of
that sacred Book as if it consisted of several detached
fragments, accidently preserved and indiscriminately grouped;
whereas those who know it best and study it most, see in it a
perfect and harmonious revelation of a perfect and harmonious
salvation.&nbsp; No one denies for one moment that it was written
by many authors, and that the fragments, as they are called, were
written at intervals, extending on the whole over more than 1500
years.&nbsp; No one denies that in the several writings you
discern the several minds and characters of the several
writers.&nbsp; No one denies that the historical accuracy of one
man, the poetic genius of another, the affectionate pastoral
earnestness of a third, and the argumentative faculty of a
fourth, are all employed, and all appear with undisguised
individuality.&nbsp; But our point is that there is no appearance
of accident or confusion, but that all these various authors have
been employed to bring out one perfect whole; that the historian,
the poet, the biographer, the letter writer, and the logician,
have all their exact place, and have all, by God&rsquo;s
inspiration, exactly filled it.&nbsp; What some men regard as a
difficulty we regard as the wonder of the Book.&nbsp; We see many
rays in the spectrum, but all are blended so as to give one
perfect light, and when we think on <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the beautiful and perfect proportions
of the whole, we are prepared to exclaim, with Dryden,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whence, but from heaven, could man
unskilled in arts,<br />
In several ages born, in several parts<br />
Weave such agreeing truths?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now if all this be true it must follow that our great object
must be not merely to preach a selection, however well made, of
detached truths, but to declare the whole counsel of God, and so
to declare it that the proportions of God&rsquo;s revelation may
be preserved.&nbsp; It is not enough that we exhibit certain of
God&rsquo;s attributes,&mdash;His righteousness, <i>e.g.</i>,
without His mercy, or His mercy without His love; or one side of
our Lord&rsquo;s nature and character,&mdash;His Godhead,
<i>e.g.</i>, without His manhood, or His manhood without His
Godhead.&nbsp; Nor is it enough that we teach certain portions of
the plan of life,&mdash;as atonement without repentance, or
repentance without atonement.&nbsp; Our great desire must be, as
faithful stewards, to declare the whole: not to select any
favourite colours in the spectrum, but to exhibit without
partiality the perfect light of the truth of God.</p>
<p>But in the application of this principle one caution has been
suggested to me by a very thoughtful friend: viz.
this,&mdash;that in an endeavour to attain to the proportionate
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>place of any
particular truths, we must take into consideration not merely the
frequency with which they are repeated, but the urgency with
which they are pressed upon our attention.&nbsp; There are some
subjects in which our opinions are formed from historical
reference to the practice of the early Church, such as Episcopal
Government and infant baptism, and however important they may
appear, they must clearly be put in a different category from
those where we have the clear command of God, or the clear
declaration that they concern the essentials of life
eternal.&nbsp; Again some subjects may cover a greater space in
Scripture, and still be of less importance than other short
passages which have been solemnly uttered as containing the very
essentials of salvation.&nbsp; The broadest band in the prism is
not the brightest, and the brightness of the one is quite as
important as the breadth of the other.&nbsp; The historical books
of the Old Testament, <i>e.g.</i>, must none be neglected; but,
though they occupy nearly one-third of the whole Book, they do
not outweigh in importance that single sentence of our blessed
Redeemer: &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say unto thee, Except a man be
born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some
portions again are only preparatory to the final development of
the perfect plan of life, and they clearly occupy a position of
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>different
proportionate importance to the plan itself.&nbsp; Each portion
of God&rsquo;s truth has its own place in the complete plan, and
the importance attached by the inspiring Spirit to each part, and
to the place of each part, is that which we really want to
ascertain.&nbsp; We want to take a comprehensive view of the
great salvation as complete in the finished work of our blessed
Redeemer, and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost at
Pentecost.&nbsp; We want not merely to look at the completed
system, but at all that God appointed to prepare the way for it,
and then without reserve, and without preference, yield ourselves
to the Divine teaching, and make it our earnest prayer that in
all His proportions, and in all His perfections, we may be taught
of God to exhibit Christ.</p>
<p>And now, having said enough on the general principle, let us
begin by applying it to the variations which exist amongst us
with reference to the great principles which lie within the
circle of Evangelical truth, and in which we are in the main
agreed.&nbsp; I hear a good deal of the disunion of the
Evangelical body, but I do not believe it.&nbsp; I am fully alive
to our defects in organization, and I believe you will always
find such defects amongst persons trained as we are to think for
ourselves, and to act on our own responsibility; but I believe
there is a vast amount of real loving Christian brotherhood <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>amongst us,
and I doubt whether in the whole world you would find five
hundred thinking men more completely of one heart and one mind
than that loving band of brethren who meet year after year in
this hall, under the presidency of our venerable friend.&nbsp;
Still we have our variations, and I venture to suggest that these
variations, such as they are, arise much more from our losing
sight of the proportions of truth, than from error as to truth
itself.&nbsp; Some, <i>e.g.</i>, of us who are deeply interested
in prophetic inquiry, may carry the subject too far, and become
too much absorbed by an intense interest of the study; while
other dear brethren have been so much impressed by our mistakes,
that they think it wiser to neglect the subject altogether; and
thus it comes to pass that the proportion of truth is missed by
us both.&nbsp; Is it not possible that some of us are so
impressed with the grandeur of the universal offer of a free
salvation in Christ Jesus, that we scarcely give sufficient
prominence to the doctrine of election; while others have our
hearts so filled with the deep sense of electing love, that we
feel some difficulty in making a universal offer?&nbsp; And in
such a case does not the difficulty arise much more from our
losing sight of the relative position of two truths, than of
either party being in error as to either one?&nbsp; Each can
prove his point, but <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the question is, Do they preserve the
proportion of truth?</p>
<p>So again, is there not a danger of those amongst us whose own
mind is occupied by the Jews, seeing everything in Jewish light,
and forgetting the election from the Gentiles; while those who
are absorbed in Gentile work are in equal danger of withholding
his proper portion from the Jew?</p>
<p>Once more, is it not a question whether, as a body, we are
giving quite sufficient prominence to the sacrament of
Baptism?&nbsp; If I were to draw any comparison between the two
sacraments, I think I must come to the conclusion that the
sacrament of Baptism occupies in Apostolic teaching a more
prominent place than the Lord&rsquo;s Supper; but I am not at all
sure that the proportion is not reversed in my own ministry, and
that much more importance is not attached to the Holy Communion
than to our Baptism into the body of Christ.&nbsp; The same may
be said of the Second Advent, and many other subjects.&nbsp; We
may be perfectly sound upon each point, and able in the most
satisfactory manner to prove each point from Scripture, but still
while maintaining truth we may be exhibiting a partial view of
truth: we may be presenting only certain colours of the spectrum,
and failing to produce the perfect light; we may be playing <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>only the bass
notes, and so losing the harmony of our music.</p>
<p>If this be the case, we shall not be drawn together by an
eager maintenance of our own particular subject, but by fixing
our thoughts on the whole.&nbsp; I am not arguing against men
taking up particular subjects and becoming absorbed in
them.&nbsp; I believe that if this were not done nothing great
would be accomplished, for no one mind is big enough for the
whole.&nbsp; But I am anxious that we should remember that other
person&rsquo;s subjects have a place in God&rsquo;s system as
well as our own; that &ldquo;the eye cannot say unto the hand, I
have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no
need of you;&rdquo; but that we all remember that &ldquo;God hath
tempered the body together;&rdquo; and that our earnest desire
must be, as one united band of brethren, to exhibit before the
world in all its proportions the whole counsel and the perfect
mind of God.</p>
<p>But, leaving these subjects, which may be defined as
variations within the Evangelical body, let us pass on to apply
the principle to some of those great questions in which the whole
body are united in the earnest struggle for the truth of God; and
let us begin with that which is undoubtedly one of the great
questions of the day,&mdash;the relative value of ritual, and
reality in religion.&nbsp; <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Now let us admit at the outset that
it is utterly impossible to have reality without ritual.&nbsp; It
is impossible for twelve men to meet together and worship God
decently and in order without a ritual of some kind or
other.&nbsp; Nay, I would go further, and say it is impossible
for any one, even alone, to pour out his heart before God without
a certain amount of ritual or form.&nbsp; There must be a certain
ritual, or external action, in harmony with the spiritual or
internal movements of the soul.&nbsp; But though you cannot have
reality without ritual, you may have ritual without
reality.&nbsp; You may have an elaborate form, notwithstanding
the total absence of the weightier matters of the law.&nbsp; It
becomes therefore a matter of deep interest for us to consider
what is the relative position of ritual in the Christian system,
and what place it occupies in sacred Scripture.</p>
<p>Now it was once said to me by an advanced Ritualist, &ldquo;If
there be an elaborate and gorgeous ritual in heaven, and if there
was an elaborate and gorgeous ritual under the law, may we not
conclude that we ought to have the same in this intermediate
dispensation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But where do we find any account of a gorgeous and elaborate
ritual in heaven?&nbsp; We do, I acknowledge, read of one
gorgeous dress &ldquo;of purple and scarlet colour, and decked
with gold and precious stones and pearls;&rdquo; but <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>that was on
the harlot.&nbsp; In all besides there is perfect
simplicity.&nbsp; The bride has no dress but &ldquo;fine linen,
clean and white;&rdquo; and when the elders were honoured with
crowns, they cast them at the feet of the Lamb, that all eyes
might be fixed on Him, and all heaven give Him His honour.&nbsp;
Nor was there any gorgeous ritual under the law.&nbsp; It is true
that the high priest wore a dress adorned with precious stones
and the most costly material that could be procured, but that was
for the simple reason that what he wore was typical of the
glorious attributes of our blessed Redeemer.&nbsp; But the dress
of the ordinary priests was perfectly simple.&nbsp; And as for
ritual, it was minute because it was prophetic: it was a
pictorial prophecy, and therefore of necessity accurate.&nbsp;
But in other respects we find no directions whatever.&nbsp; The
argument therefore completely falls to the ground; and we have to
consider simply the position occupied by ritual in the New
Testament.&nbsp; And what do we find there?&nbsp; Absolutely
nothing: not even in the administration of the sacraments do we
find a single direction beyond the name and the water in Baptism,
and the use of bread and wine in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp;
Beyond these points not a hint is given.&nbsp; Whether it should
be received standing, sitting, or kneeling; what words should be
used, and who should use them; whether there should <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>be a liturgy
or extempore prayer, and indeed whether there should be any
prayer at all,&mdash;all these things are left without any notice
in the Word of God.</p>
<p>But I must be careful what I say, for I once had a pamphlet
sent me purporting to give Scriptural authority for some of these
modern innovations.&nbsp; It maintained that the cloak, the
&phi;&alpha;&iota;&lambda;&#972;&nu;&eta;, which St. Paul left at
Troas, was his chasuble, without which he could not celebrate
mass at Rome; and that the many lights which sent Eutychus to
sleep were the many candles with which the altar at Troas was
adorned.&nbsp; If men believe that, it is vain to argue with
them.&nbsp; But this much we may safely conclude,&mdash;that if
these be the only arguments that can be produced, the men who
urged them must have been very hard up for an authority.&nbsp;
Our conclusion therefore remains untouched, that the whole of the
New Testament is occupied by the great realities of the Gospel of
Christ; and that, so far as Scripture is concerned, there is not
even a hint as to ritual.&nbsp; And what is the grand
conclusion?&nbsp; Is it not surely this,&mdash;that if we would
keep to the proportions of truth we must not allow the thoughts
to be led off by ritual, but must keep well in view the great
realities of life and death, of forgiveness, of purification, new
life, and everlasting salvation: the great things of the Gospel,
the weighty matters revealed in the Word of God.&nbsp; Even when
contending <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>against innovation we must not allow the interest of the
contest to draw our thoughts from great realities.&nbsp; And in
our own peaceful and parochial work we must not disturb our
people by needless changes, even though some of them may seem to
ourselves to be improvements; and we must take good heed that,
while all things are ordered as becometh the house of God, the
great law of proportion is observed, and the minds of our young
people not drawn off by the form and furniture of worship.&nbsp;
I was deeply impressed not long ago by the importance of this
principle in its bearing upon missions.&nbsp; In missions you
have a great reality that fills the Scriptures.&nbsp; History,
prophecy, biography, command, and promise, all unite in urging
the sacred work of missions.&nbsp; I was anxious to ascertain to
what extent the missionary spirit flourished in conjunction with
costly ritual; and I thought the best test that I could apply was
to ascertain how much was contributed to the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel by some of those churches that are most
renowned for ritual.&nbsp; I selected seven, with the names of
which I happened to be familiar. <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; I then turned
to the last report of the Society for the Propagation of the <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Gospel, in
order to ascertain how much they gave for missions, and I found
that the aggregate contributions by all seven together to the
general fund amounted to the amazing sum of &pound;7 13<i>s.</i>
2<i>d.</i>&nbsp; I ought to say that St. Albans added &pound;5
13<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> for a special fund for Honolulu.&nbsp; So
that, taking into account the gifts to particular dioceses, as
well as those to the general fund, the total contributed by the
seven churches to foreign missions, through the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel, amounted to &pound;13 7<i>s.</i>&nbsp;
And yet the incumbent of one or them (St. Andrew&rsquo;s, Wells
Street) stated in evidence before the Ritual Commission, that the
cost of his choir alone was &ldquo;about &pound;1000 a
year.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it not high time that men lay to heart the
proportion to be observed between ritual and the reality of
religion?</p>
<p>But now let us go a step further, and apply this law of
proportion to what is commonly called the sacramental
system.&nbsp; I heard this well defined not long since, in a very
able sermon by an advanced Ritualist.&nbsp; He supposed a person
in America anxious to communicate with his friend in England, and
asked the question whether he would do so by direct communication
through the air, or through the medium of the telegraphic
wires.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the question
is whether God has been pleased to communicate direct with the <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>soul, or has
chosen to do so through the medium of His priests and
sacraments.&rdquo;&nbsp; My own belief is that that was a very
fair statement of the point at issue, and I am anxious to bring
it to the test of the law of proportion, and to ascertain as far
as we can what proportionate place this intermediate system
occupies in the Word of God.&nbsp; But here I meet with a great
difficulty, for when I turn to my Bible the system, as a system,
is not to be found.&nbsp; I know not therefore how to bring it to
the balance; all I can attempt therefore is to consider it in
detail, and to examine separately the different parts of the
telegraphic system.&nbsp; Let us begin with confession and
absolution.</p>
<p>Respecting confession to a priest, not one word is to be found
in any portion of the New Testament; and with reference to
absolution by a priest, there is not a passage which can be
quoted with any semblance, of authority, except that one most
difficult verse in the Gospel of St. John.&nbsp; I am not about
to discuss that verse, or to endeavour to decide whether the
words were spoken to the whole Church or to the Apostles, or
whether, if to the Apostles, they describe a gift as one to be
permanently transmitted, or to terminate with, the
Apostleship.&nbsp; My object is to point out that if they
referred to a gift to be transmitted through the Apostles <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>to priests,
if the transmission were to stop at priests and not descend to
deacons, and if the forgiveness, and therefore the salvation of
the whole Church were dependent on the exercise by a priest of
the transmitted power,&mdash;it is to my mind perfectly
inconceivable that the revelation of God should be completed and
closed, without containing one single sentence either as to the
law of transmission, or the exercise of so tremendous and
mysterious a power.&nbsp; In the Acts we have the record of
Apostolic missions.&nbsp; In the Epistles we have twenty-one
addresses to Christian Churches, three of which were exclusively
devoted to the subject of the ministry; while passages bearing on
the relationship between ministers and people are perpetually
recurring.&nbsp; From one end of the Book to the other, the great
subject of forgiveness is mentioned again and again; and yet,
with reference to what was termed at Nottingham,
&ldquo;sacramental confession and absolution,&rdquo; though the
application of life is supposed to depend on it, not a single
hint is given.</p>
<p>Should these words be ever brought to the notice of those
earnest men with whom we have lately been recommended to
cultivate union, I would earnestly intreat them to consider
whether the Apostles placed absolution and confession in the same
position that they <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>are doing; and if not, I would suggest to those zealous
men the further question, whether the difference may not be
explained by their having completely mistaken the words of our
Lord.</p>
<p>Turn next to sacrifice.&nbsp; Now if there be any continuation
in any form of a propitiatory sacrifice for sin we must all admit
that it is of the utmost possible importance.&nbsp; If it be
God&rsquo;s institution there is no describing the loss of those
who live without it.&nbsp; But here I am met with the remarkable
fact that, when I look for the theory in the Word of God, I find
no trace of it.&nbsp; There is no allusion to a priest, for the
&#8150;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&rho;&gamma;&omicron;&#8166;&nu;&tau;&alpha;
of Rom. xv. 16, has manifestly nothing to do with the
subject.&nbsp; There is no altar, unless Heb. xiii. 10, be
referred to, which very few are bold enough to attempt to refer
to a sacrificial altar in the Church.&nbsp; There is not a hint
as to the persons administering the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, which is
very strange if all the virtue is really dependent on the
transmitted priesthood of the sacerdotal sacrifices.&nbsp; And
above all, there is not one word about sacrifice in the words of
institution, unless it be that
&tau;&omicron;&#8166;&tau;&omicron;
&pi;&omicron;&iota;&epsilon;&#8150;&tau;&epsilon; means, and must
mean, &ldquo;perform this sacrifice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole
system hangs on the unproved and unsupported sense, arbitrarily
given to these two perfectly simple words, and I would most
earnestly put it to those who believe in the <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>continuation
of propitiatory sacrifice,&mdash;is there any evidence for the
doctrine which bears the least appreciable proportion to its
intense and overwhelming importance.</p>
<p>The same may be said of the real presence.&nbsp; I am not now
speaking of transubstantiation simple, but of the statement that
in each element there is present a real true living
Saviour,&mdash;body, soul, and divinity.&nbsp; Now I fully admit
that those who believe in this do not make at all too much of
it.&nbsp; I do not see how it is possible to make too much of
it.&nbsp; If that same Lord and Saviour who was born at Bethlehem
and died on Calvary, is seated on the communion table, as really,
and if I may so speak, as socially, as he was seated at the
Paschal Supper, so that we may speak to Him there and then, as a
person visible before us, I can imagine no adoration too
profound, no love too deep to be consecrated to such a
presence.&nbsp; If I believed it, my present thought is that I
could never leave the Church and never cease to speak of
it.&nbsp; It seems as though I must be ever telling those that
look for Him, that I have found the Messiah.&nbsp; But here I am
met with this most extraordinary difficulty,&mdash;that His own
Apostles and inspired writers never once alluded to the
subject.&nbsp; They often spoke, it is true, of breaking bread,
and in one Epistle the Apostle Paul <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>entered fully into the subject of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper; but the only two texts that I know of as
having been ever forced into a reference, are: &ldquo;Not
discerning the Lord&rsquo;s body,&rdquo;&mdash;which has no
allusion to the living person; and the original words of
institution: &ldquo;This is My body and this is My blood,&rdquo;
which distinctly teach a separation in the parts, as opposed to a
union of the whole in the person of a living Lord in either
element.&nbsp; But I am not stopping to discuss particular
texts.&nbsp; Let those who believe the doctrine think what they
please respecting them, and I would earnestly ask them to
consider two questions.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; Did the Apostles give the same proportionate place
to the doctrine of the real presence that they are doing?&nbsp;
Did it occupy the same place in St. Paul&rsquo;s teaching as in
theirs?</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; Is the authority for the doctrine at all in
proportion to the overwhelming weight of its interest and
importance?</p>
<p>Test the matter by the law of proportion, and I have no doubt
as to the issue.</p>
<p>But now turn to the other side,&mdash;the direct and personal
reinstatement of the sinner before God: and here I am as much at
a loss as I was before; but not as before to find a text, but
because the whole Book of God is full <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>of the subject.&nbsp; It fills the
Scriptures as the air fills the room.&nbsp; It is not here or
there, but everywhere.&nbsp; In the Old Testament it is
predicted, in the New Testament fully manifested.&nbsp; In the
teaching of our Lord, in the sermons of His missionaries, in the
letters of His Apostles, in all alike you find it.&nbsp; Present
and complete forgiveness, complete justification, finished
atonement through the perfect sacrifice once for all, and the
ever living, never changing advocacy of our blessed Redeemer now
at the right hand of the throne of God,&mdash;these are subjects
not dependent on forced interpretations of minute texts, but
which form the substance of the whole teaching of God.&nbsp; They
meet you everywhere and you cannot avoid them.&nbsp; I do not
quote them, for there would be no end of it.&nbsp; If I wanted,
<i>e.g.</i>, to quote on the doctrine of justification by faith,
I must begin by quoting the two Epistles to the Romans and
Galatians; or if on the finished sacrifice and present Priesthood
of our Lord and Redeemer, I must begin with the whole Epistle to
the Hebrews.&nbsp; We do not rely on words only but on chapters,
and not on chapters only, but on whole books,&mdash;books
inspired for this very purpose; and not on separate books only,
but on the whole united testimony of the whole collection of
books which God has interwoven together as an abiding witness to
the faith once delivered to the saints.</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>We
trust to the whole great, grand, aggregate of the Gospel, and
from the whole we learn that there is nothing intermediate
between us and our God, but that the atonement being complete,
the veil of the temple has been rent from the top to the bottom,
and that now there is nothing left but the deadness of our own
hearts to prevent our passing in at once, alone, and just as we
are, to cast ourselves, in the full assurance of complete
reconciliation, for all we need, before the mercy-seat of
God.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
